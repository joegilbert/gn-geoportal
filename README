GN-Geoportal is a portal for searching and displaying spatial metadata records in a GeoNetwork catalog (http://geonetwork-opensource.org/).  GN-Geoportal is written in Ruby and employs the Sinatra DSL (http://www.sinatrarb.com/).  These instructions assume you have access to an instance of GeoNetwork running locally or remotely.

INSTALLATION

First install the required gems (requires RubyGems 1.3 or higher):

gem sources --add http://gems.github.com/
sudo gem install rack rack-test nokogiri haml chriseppstein-compass

If the installation of Nokogiri fails, make sure you have the Ruby development package installed (ruby-devel in Fedora or ruby-dev in Ubuntu).

CONFIGURATION

The Geonetwork hostname, URL, and title are set in lib/config.rb.  A config.example file is included.  You likely will also want to edit the helpers in app.rb to point to any interactive map (WMS-based) or KML/KMZ link locations.

RUNNING GN-GEOPORTAL

To run the application at http://localhost:4567 via WEBrick, type:

ruby app.rb

A config.ru file is also included for Rack-based deployment.  With Rack (http://rack.rubyforge.org/) installed, go to the project folder and type:

rackup

The default Rack address is http://localhost:9292.

EDITING STYLES

The HTML and CSS used by GN-Geoportal are generated using Haml (http://haml-lang.com/) and Sass (http://sass-lang.com/) and build upon the Blueprint CSS framework (http://www.blueprintcss.org/).

Rather than directly editing GN-Geoportal's CSS files, make changes to src/*.sass and regenerate the CSS with Compass (http://compass-style.org/) using the configuration in config/config.rb:

cd config
compass -u
